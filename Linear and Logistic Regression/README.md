Lab2 - Linear and Logistic Regression
=====================================

Introduction
------------

This project contains two parts

1. Implementing Linear Regression to predict the age of Abalone (is a type of snail)

2. Experimenting with regularized logistic regression and linear discriminants to predict whether credit card can be issued to an individual


* Please refer to [Report.pdf](Report.pdf) for detailed analysis.
* Please refer to [lab.pdf](lab.pdf) for about the project.
* The code was developed and tested in Matlab 2017a. If possible, use the same version.

Part 1 (Linear Regression)
==========================

To Run
------

Task are number as per lab.pdf Linear Ridge Regression part

1. Run task 4 using

task4

You can optionally specify fraction (default 0.2) using

task4(0.5)

2. Run task 6 using

task6

You can optionally specify fraction (default 0.2) using

task6(fraction)

e.g. 

task6(0.5)

3. Run task 7 using

task7

Part 2 (Regularized Logistic Regression)
========================================

To Run
------

Task are number as per lab.pdf Regularized Logistic Regression part

1. Run task 2 using

task2

2. Run task 4 using

task4

You can optionally specify degree (default 3), lambda (default 0) using

task4(degree, lambda)

e.g.
