Lab3 - Neural Network and Self Driving Cars
===========================================

Introduction
------------

This project contains two parts

1.Experimenting with multi-layer perceptron. A simple 2 dimensional
3 class classification problem to visualize decision boundaries learned by a MLP. The second part of the lab
takes time to train

2. Neural network to predict the steering angle the road image for a self-driving car application that is inspired by Udacityâ€™s Behavior. Performed the following modifications to the networks to try better models with the constraint that these were implemented from scratch. (some of them are easy to implement, while some took a significant amount of time)
Implement convolution layers
Implement a different activation function
Implement Max Pooling layers
Implement and try a different optimizer (such as Adam or RMS Prop)

Note
----
Code was tested on Matlab 2017a.
